# logentries_rsyslog_ng

* This cookbook is intended to be LWRP for logentries logging service.
* It's not finished yet, so no documentation yet and use on your own
risk.
* I'll write docs later, after I finish all supposed LWRP actions and
  stabilize cookbook a bit.

# Requirements

* debian 7
* rsyslog 7.x+
